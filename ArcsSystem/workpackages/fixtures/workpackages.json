Therefore, it is important from the beginning to have guidelines for publishing the data. As with data archiving, participant privacy (i.e. GDPR) and long-term accessibility to the data are important issues to take into account when starting a citizen science project. Especially when participants are collecting sensitive information (such as locations of rare and threatened species) it is important to think about the detail of data that is published as open access, as publishing too detailed information might decrease participation. Open publishing of data can also lead to participants checking the results for potential errors, as a way of improving data quality. When participants upload files as part of the data entry, an automated agreement to a create commons license can help circumvent copyright issues when publishing the data. Open publishing of the data and communication of the results to participants can further increase participant motivation to continue participating and collecting data. Proper feedback in that respect can further increase data quality.",
