Det betyder att man aktivt deltar, dvs att man utför faktiska forskningsuppgifter, i forskningsprocessen. Hur det skall göras möjligt för andra än forskare att på detta sätt aktivt inkluderas i forskningsprocessen är den etiska aspekt som oftast förekommer inom medborgarforskningen. Specifika etiska aspekter som lyfts inom inklusionstemat rör hur frivilliga engageras och motiveras att delta, samtidigt som dessa individer inte får exploateras, när de delar aktivt i forskningsprocessen. Vidare hur man som forskare skall hantera sådana aspekter som anonymitet, integritet och övervakning i relation till deltagare.

We define validation as a quality control step in which the data that is received is tested for potential sources of error and potentially erroneous data flagged (data cleaning). In any citizen science project it is crucial that the data collected is of known quality. Known quality can be either verified to be accurate (e.g. through verifying records, images) or achieved by quantifying the degree of error or bias (e.g. from a sample of the data that can be accounted for in analyses and applications). 

An automated screening of data, as described in the receiving theme, can be one way of data validation, checking if the data is submitted in the right format. Automated data screening can also be used to compare the data collected by participants to reference databases to pinpoint potential errors in the observations. When the data collection is (partly) done through a medium like a picture or sound file, these data are verifiable and can be checked by machine learning algorithms and/or by experts. These experts can be employed scientists, but they can also be selected participants that have proven to be experienced in identifying and verifying data. Another option is to have multiple volunteers check the verifiable data, where an algorithm can select the most likely identification. Which of these methods is usable in a citizen science project depends on the size of the project and the complexity of the task. In any case, it is important to provide feedback to participants if data was incorrectly entered or verifiable data sources (images or sound files etc.) were misidentified. Social media or other platforms where participants can discuss about data and give each other feedback might facilitate the assurance of data quality.

Random errors will increase the ‘noise’ in some citizen science data (e.g. inaccurate counts), thus making it harder to accurately detect signals from the data. However, many errors are often systematic and dependent on factors like people’s location, experience and motivation. The lack of absence data is a common and often overlooked source of error. People are more likely to records the presence of something, and especially something rare or out-of-the-ordinary, thus causing systematic bias in the data.
