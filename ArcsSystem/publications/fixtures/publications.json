This case study describes the use of social media to support participants of the New Zealand Garden Bird Survey and examines the group\u2019s interactions in its first year through the lens of a community of practice. Communities of practice can provide forums for learning, which is an important outcome of participation by environmental volunteers. Social media can provide the setting for an online community of practice that can support dispersed groups of volunteers and requires little daily input from administrators. While the NZ Garden Bird Survey runs for only nine days annually in June\u2013July, this Facebook group continued to be active and attract new members throughout the year. In the first year of its existence, the group grew to 1,275 members who generated nearly 75,000 interactions (posts, comments, likes, and shares). The group was used to share enthusiasm, ideas, and knowledge about New Zealand\u2019s garden birds. A wide range of birding expertise, from novice to expert, was displayed. The group\u2019s interactions include shared interests, contributed stories, and collective learning. This paper documents our experiences setting up and administering this group and provides advice for citizen science programs that want to use social media to support a community of practice.", "doi": "10.5334/cstp.108", "py": 2018, "authors": "Liberatore, Andrea; Bowkett, Erin; MacLeod, Catriona J.; Spurr, Eric; Longnecker, Nancy", "source": "Citizen Science: Theory and Practice", "volume": 3, "issue": 1}}, {"model": "publications.article", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "Citizen science and observer variability during American pika surveys", "abstract": "Within- and between-group observer variability can confound scientific discovery. If observer variability can be quantified and is addressed, data collected by participants with wide ranges of experience and training can yield more reliable inferences. The American pika (Ochotona princeps) is a mammalian sentinel of climate change that has received consideration for listing under the United States Endangered Species Act. As a result, numerous pika monitoring initiatives have been started throughout the mountains in western North America. Some initiatives employ research teams of biological science technicians (professionals), whereas many rely on networks of citizen scientists, or volunteers, for data collection. To date, few studies have quantified observer variability during pika surveys; none have explored the reliability of professional crews or volunteers. We conducted pika surveys in Glacier National Park, Montana, to quantify observer variability. We investigated observer variability 1) among a crew of professionals, 2) among volunteers, and 3) between professionals and volunteers. Professionals were more consistent at identifying pika signs and estimating potential home ranges and consistently found more pika signs than did the volunteers, with the exception of pika sightings. Estimates of pika occupancy were consistent at each site among volunteers conducting sitting surveys. We suggest that sitting surveys conducted by volunteers can reliably detect pika site occupancy. However, data on population dynamics of pikas (e.g., density) should be collected by professionals. Observer variability analyses of this nature should be common practice for wildlife-resource managers and scientists, especially with observers of varying levels of experience and motivation.

Departing from how science and politics are constructed as a contrast, as recently put forth by philosopher Bruno Latour, the scientific method for creating reference and the political method for gaining representation are analysed as they are articulated in citizen science. This evokes further contradictions between local acts of resistance and the global aspirations of scientific methods, challenging both the particularity of micropolitics and the universality of science. Building on previous case studies of citizen science practices, a number of conclusions are drawn regarding the potentials and dangers emerging from a science that takes place in the peripheries of established institutions. The article concludes that citizen science can be a very successful resistance practice, as long as it is able to produce novel facts that still adhere to scientific methods and standards and remains connected to the established institutions of science.", "doi": null, "py": 2015, "authors": "Kullenberg, Christopher", "source": "Journal of Resistance Studies", "volume": 1, "issue": 1}}, {"model": "publications.article", "pk": 6, "fields": {"title": "Air concentrations of volatile compounds near oil and gas production  a community-based exploratory study", "abstract": "", "doi": null, "py": 2014, "authors": "Macey, Gregg P.; Breech, Ruth; Chernaik, Mark; Cox, Caroline; Larson, Denny; Thomas, Deb; Carpenter, David O.", "source": "Environmental Health", "volume": 13, "issue": 1}}, {"model": "publications.article", "pk": 7, "fields": {"title": "From Citizen Science to Do It Yourself Science", "abstract": "", "doi": null, "py": 2014, "authors": "Nascimento, Susana; Pereira, \u00c2ngela Guimar\u00e3es; Ghezzi, Alessia", "source": "", "volume": null, "issue": null}}, {"model": "publications.article", "pk": 8, "fields": {"title": "The Countercultural Potential of Citizen Science", "abstract": "", "doi": null, "py": 2014, "authors": "McQuillan, Dan", "source": "M/C Journal", "volume": 17, "issue": 6}}, {"model": "publications.article", "pk": 9, "fields": {"title": "Trading-off fish biodiversity, food security, and hydropower in the Mekong River Basin", "abstract": "", "doi": null, "py": 2012, "authors": "Ziv, Guy; Baran, Eric; Nam, So; Rodr\u00edguez-Iturbe, Ignacio; Levin, Simon A.", "source": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "volume": 109, "issue": 15}}, {"model": "publications.article", "pk": 10, "fields": {"title": "Knowledge Gain and Behavioral Change in Citizen-Science Programs", "abstract": "Citizen-science programs are often touted as useful for advancing conservation literacy, scientific knowledge, and increasing scientific-reasoning skills among the public. Guidelines for collaboration among scientists and the public are lacking and the extent to which these citizen-science initiatives change behavior is relatively unstudied. Over two years, we studied 82 participants in a three-day program that included education about non-native invasive plants and collection of data on the occurrence of those plants. Volunteers were given background knowledge about invasive plant ecology and trained on a specific protocol for collecting invasive plant data. They then collected data and later gathered as a group to analyze data and discuss responsible environmental behavior with respect to invasive plants. We tested whether participants without experience in plant identification and with little knowledge of invasive plants increased their knowledge of invasive species ecology, participation increased knowledge of scientific methods, and participation affected behavior. Knowledge of invasive plants increased on average 24%, but participation was insufficient to increase understanding of how scientific research is conducted. Participants reported increased ability to recognize invasive plants and increased awareness of effects of invasive plants on the environment, but this translated into little change in behavior regarding invasive plants. Potential conflicts between scientific goals, educational goals, and the motivation of participants must be considered during program design.", "doi": "10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01745.x", "py": 2011, "authors": "Jordan, Rebecca C.; Gray, Steven A.; Howe, David V.; Brooks, Wesley R.; Ehrenfeld, Joan G.", "source": "CONSERVATION BIOLOGY", "volume": 25, "issue": 6}}]
