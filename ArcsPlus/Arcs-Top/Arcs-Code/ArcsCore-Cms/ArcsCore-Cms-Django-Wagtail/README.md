#Description: Implementation of Django using the WagtailCMS as an app for the
# ArcsSystem project. This has a self contained admin for the page management
# while the remainder of the apps will be controlled by the Django Admin default
# view. This approach is taken to enable the ArcsSystem to be modular where
# other approaches could be used in place of this CMS solution. Wagtail also
# contains an API for interactions with its content.
# See: https://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.8/advanced_topics/api/ (select API version)
