#Description: The following is a reference Config for setup and configuration of
# the ArcsSystem for Citizen Science which allows for hosting a variety of apps
# for those interested in curating citizen science projects, content, and
# outputs.

# Set Instance Type:
#  "Dev" (Development): configures parameters and files for local testing  
#                      and provides debugging support.
#  "Test" (Testing): configures paramters and files for live hosting with
#                   debugging support.
#  "Prod" (Production): configures paramters and files for live deployment locking
                        down the configurations without debugging only logging.
Instance="Dev"

# Primary Host Root DOMAIN: 
#   This can be in the format of example.com or subexample.example.com and all 
#   URLs for the platform will take form at and below the Root. This choice will 
#   have implications for your site's TLS certificates aka for https to be 
#   valid.
#       For example: 
          if you enter "medborgarforskning.se" your search would be at 
           search.medborgarforskning.se
          if you enter "sub.medborgarforskning.se" your search URL would be at
           search.sub.medborgarforskning.se.
DefaultDomain="medborgarforskning.se"


# Location of Certificates for inclusion on the Server.
# Default relative to setup.sh: /certificates

# Selection of which components of the ARCSSystem to spin up. Current script 
#   only currently assumes single server configuration for all containers.

# All lines below this are TODO and not yet supported 

# TODO - Implement Certbot for LetsEncrypt default if no certificates found
#  for naked domain https://certbot.eff.org/
# TODO - Also implement Wildcard Certificate for all subdomains - implements as
#  a docker container. See: https://certbot.eff.org/docs/install.html#running-with-docker

# Secondary Domains:
# TODO - secondary domain support not implemented. Allow for hosting at both 
#         native language URLs and other languages. Implement with primary as
#         canonical URL on all pages for search indexing.

# Multiple Server Scalable-Production Config:
# TODO - setup for process for hosting containers on multiple servers for 
#         scaling, load balancing, etc.
